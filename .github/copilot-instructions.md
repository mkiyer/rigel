# Rigel Project Instructions

## Environment

- **Always** activate the conda environment before running any command: `conda activate rigel`
- Python 3.12+, C++17
- Dependencies managed via `mamba_env.yaml` (conda-forge + bioconda channels)

## Build

```bash
# After ANY C++ change in src/rigel/native/, you MUST recompile:
conda activate rigel && pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

Do not skip recompilation after editing `.cpp`, `.h`, or `CMakeLists.txt` files.

## Testing

```bash
conda activate rigel
pytest tests/ -v                          # all tests
pytest tests/test_em_impl.py -v           # single file
pytest tests/test_em_impl.py::test_name   # single test
pytest tests/ --update-golden             # regenerate golden outputs after intentional changes
```

- Known pre-existing failure: `tests/test_calibration.py::TestStrandLLR::test_biased_toward_ss_favors_rna` — unrelated to scoring/EM.
- Golden output regression files live in `tests/golden/`.

### Test Failure Investigation

- When a test fails, DO NOT reconfigure the test or change tolerances to make the test pass.
- Consider a test failure as a sentinel event with critical information that alludes to a larger problem with the code or methodology. 
- Conduct analysis to understand WHY the test failed, determine the precise root cause of the failure, and evaluate possible solutions
- If the explanation and fix for the failed test is not clear, you should propose a plan for further investigation.

## Linting

Ruff configured in `pyproject.toml`: Python 3.12 target, 100-char line length.

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format src/ tests/
```

## Documentation

- Publish implementation plans to the `docs/` directory as markdown files. Use subfolders for organization. Avoid polluting the base `docs/` directory.

## Scripts

- Diagnostic exploration and debugging scripts are commonly needed. For organization, put them in `scripts/debug/` with description names. Avoid polluting the base `scripts/` directory.

## Simulations / Benchmarking / Profiling

- Create temporary scripts in `scripts/benchmark/`, `scripts/profiling/`, or `scripts/simulation/` as needed. Try not to pollute the base `scripts/` directory.

## Benchmarking

`scripts/benchmark.py` contains a framework for running full-scale simulations, comparing multiple methods, and generating summary tables.

## Profiling

`scripts/profiler.py` contains a framework for profiling.

## Simulation

`scripts/synthetic_sim_sweep.py` contains a framework for running synthetic simulations with configurable parameters.

## Synthetic Benchmark Framework

│   ├── locus_simple_baseline.yaml
│   ├── locus_simple_em_prior.yaml
│   ├── locus_simple_em_mode.yaml
│   ├── locus_simple_strand.yaml

├── analyze_golden.py     # Summary statistics across all sweeps
└── analyze_deep.py       # Deep drill-down: nRNA siphon, gDNA leakage, param sensitivity
```

### How to Run Benchmarks

```bash
conda activate rigel

# Run a single sweep (output goes to golden/ for comparison)
python scripts/synthetic_sim_sweep.py \
  -c scripts/benchmark/configs/<name>.yaml \
  -o scripts/benchmark/golden/<name>

# Run all sweeps
for cfg in scripts/benchmark/configs/*.yaml; do
  name=$(basename "$cfg" .yaml)
  python scripts/synthetic_sim_sweep.py -c "$cfg" -o "scripts/benchmark/golden/$name"
done
```

### How to Analyze Results

```bash
# Summary statistics (aggregate error metrics per sweep)
python scripts/benchmark/analyze_golden.py

# Deep analysis (nRNA siphon breakdown, gDNA leakage, per-parameter sensitivity)
python scripts/benchmark/analyze_deep.py
```

### How to Add a New Benchmark Config

Create a YAML file in `scripts/benchmark/configs/`. The sweep framework (`synthetic_sim_sweep.py`) supports these sweepable parameter dimensions:

- **Simulation params**: `strand_specificity`, `gdna_fraction`, per-entity `n_rna_fragments`
- **EM params** (`em_config`): `prior_pseudocount`, `mode` (map/vbem), `convergence_delta`, `max_iterations`
- **BAM scan params** (`scan_config`): (none currently sweepable)
- **Scoring params** (`scoring_config`): `overhang_log_penalty`, `mismatch_log_penalty`

Each dimension in `sweep_dims` creates a Cartesian product grid. Use `n_rna_fragments` + `gdna_fraction` mode (not `n_fragments`) to keep RNA counts fixed while varying gDNA contamination.

### Benchmark Workflow (for Copilot)

When asked to run benchmarks, compare to gold standard, and analyze results:

1. **Recompile** if any C++ changes: `pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`
2. **Run** all benchmark configs (or a specific one) using the commands above
3. **Analyze** with `analyze_golden.py` (summary) and `analyze_deep.py` (deep dive)
4. **Compare** new results against golden TSVs — look for regressions in mRNA/nRNA/gDNA relative error
5. **Report** findings with focus on: (a) nRNA siphon magnitude, (b) gDNA leakage at low contamination, (c) any hyperparameter sensitivity changes
6. **Root cause** any regressions by examining which NTA1/TA1 ratio or ss/gdna_fraction combinations degraded

### Known Benchmark Findings (baseline)

- **nRNA siphon** is the dominant failure mode: when NTA1 >> TA1 (ratio ≥ 5), the nRNA component absorbs mRNA fragments causing up to ~37% mRNA error. This is a fundamental identifiability issue, not a hyperparameter problem.
- **gDNA overestimation** at low contamination (gdna_fraction=0.3): relative error ~1.5–2.0×, improving at higher contamination.
- **Scoring penalties** (overhang, mismatch) show zero sensitivity in synthetic data (no mismatches in simulated reads).
- **EM hyperparameters** (prior_pseudocount 0.1–5.0, MAP vs VBEM) have negligible effect.

## Architecture Summary

Two-stage pipeline: (1) C++ BAM scan → FragmentBuffer, (2) Python/C++ locus-level EM quantification.

- **C++ extensions** (`src/rigel/native/`): `_bam_impl`, `_em_impl`, `_scoring_impl`, `_resolve_impl`, `_cgranges_impl` — compiled via scikit-build-core + nanobind + CMake
- **Scoring model**: mRNA, nRNA, and gDNA candidates scored with strand, fragment-length, overhang, and NM mismatch penalties
- **EM solver**: Per-locus EM with `2*n_t + 1` components (mRNA + nRNA per transcript + one gDNA), SQUAREM acceleration, OpenMP parallel
- **Calibration**: gDNA density, strand balance, and fragment length deconvolution via `calibrate_gdna()` in `calibration.py` — EM mixture model on genomic regions with hard constraints and adaptive shrinkage

## Key Constraints

- Mega-loci (large connected components from multimappers) are difficult to avoid with real data. The EM solver must be robust to loci with thousands of transcripts and millions of fragments.
- `read_length` in resolve_context.h is the sum of aligned exon block spans (M/D/=/X), NOT the full query sequence length. Soft-clipped bases are excluded.
- Chimeric fragments are detected and buffered but **skipped** in scoring — they never enter EM.
- Input BAM must be name-sorted with `NH` tag (minimap2 doesn't set NH; the code handles this via secondary flag detection).

## C++ Compilation Details

- C++17, `-O3`, LTO enabled
- `_scoring_impl` uses `-ffast-math`; `_em_impl` uses `-ffp-contract=fast` (preserves Kahan summation)
- SIMD: `fast_exp.h` provides AVX2/AVX-512/NEON code paths
- multithreading for parallel BAM scanning and batch locus EM
